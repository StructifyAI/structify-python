Introduction
=============
Structify powers you and your AI tools to collect custom datasets on demand.

Imagine what you could do with human-quality data delivered at superhuman speeds.

Key Features
------------
* **Custom Data, At Your Fingertips**: Our AI agents populate your datasets using a variety of sources including the Internet and documents.
* **Personalized Schemas**: Define any schema you'd like for your datasets.
* **Automated Entity Resolution**: Structify ensures that your data is clean, consistent, and free of duplicates.
* **Backsourcing**: Each piece of data is connected to the source or sources we used to collect it.

How It Works
------------
Structify uses our in-house trained AI agents to populate and maintain your datasets.
When you structure a dataset, Structify spins up AI agents to populate your custom schema by indexing information from the sources you specify.

Our agents have been trained to extract data from a variety of sources, including the web, PDFs, and more.
In particular, our agents are adept at navigating the Web to find relevant information to your custom schema and then structuring it to populate your dataset.

Soon, you will see how much fun it is to "structify" your data.
