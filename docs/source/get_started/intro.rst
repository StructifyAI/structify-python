Introduction
=============
Structify powers you and your AI tools to collect custom datasets on demand.

There are countless use cases for Structify. Just imagine what you could do with human-quality data delivered at superhuman speeds.

Key Features
------------
* **Custom Data, At Your Fingertips**: Our AI sources your datasets using a variety of sources from the Internet to documents.
* **Personalized Schemas**: Define whatever schema you want for your datasets, or let our LLM handle that part.
* **Automated Entity Resolution**: Structify ensures that your data is clean, consistent, and free of duplicates.
* **Backsourcing**: Each piece of data is connected to the source or sources we used to collect it.
* **Confidence Scores**: Our reasoning engine bakes confidence metrics into each data point.
* **Notifications**: Get realtime alerts when data you care about changes.


How It Works
------------
Structify relies on knowledge graphs and AI agents to populate and maintain your datasets.

Intro to Knowledge Graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Structify uses knowledge graphs to understand the world and the data it contains.
A knowledge graph is a structured way to represent knowledge in a graph format. It consists of nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) that connect these nodes. Each entity represents a piece of information, such as a person, place, event, or concept, and each relationship represents how entities are connected to each other.

Core Components of Knowledge Graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Entities (Nodes)**: In programming terms, you can think of entities as objects or instances of classes that contain properties or attributes. For example, in a knowledge graph about books, each book could be an entity with attributes like title, author, and publication year.
* **Relationships (Edges)**: These are akin to the relationships in relational databases or associations between objects in object-oriented programming. They define how entities are related to each other. For example, a "written by" relationship might connect a book entity to an author entity.
* **Properties**: Both entities and relationships can have properties. For a programmer, these can be thought of as metadata providing more context or attributes to nodes and edges. For instance, a "published on" property could be associated with the "written by" relationship.

Imagine a simple knowledge graph representing a book database. In this graph:

* Nodes represent entities such as books, authors, and publishers.
* Edges represent relationships like "written by," "published by," and "belongs to genre."
* Properties on nodes and edges could include "publication date," "genre name," or "author birthdate."

Creating Knowledge Graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our knowledge graphs are built by AI agents that index information from a variety of sources, including the web, documents, and other datasets.

*Since we acknowledge most of the world isn't familiar with the power of knowledge graphs, you'll notice that our docs are written in tabular (or close to tabular) language.*

Getting Started
---------------
The best part of Structify is that it's easy to start seeing the power of our API. You can start by creating a dataset and then adding data to it in these simple steps:

#. Get your API Key by `emailing us <mailto:team@structify.ai>`_.
#. Define your first dataset. See :ref:`define-schema`.
#. Add data to your dataset. See :ref:`populating-datasets`.

And just like that, you've gathered your first dataset using Structify.
